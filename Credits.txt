TCONFIG EDITION SPECIAL THANKS:
*Yoraizor (is responsible for virtually all of the unique features related to the Dark Souls aspects of the mod and has always been super helpful)
*Surfpup (made tConfig - would have never attempted to get into modding without tconfig's added accessibility.
*Surfpup again for updating tConfig to version 0.36, making TSORC playable again in 2018! Hurray!
*W1k (helped me a ton with mod questions)
*Draykon (made the initial Dark Souls mechanic for the mod in like 3 hours!)
*Diggaroo, Zebri and Triangular Satellite (each made a great trailer for the mod)
*Omnir (a ton of the mod content is from his Omnir mod. The guy just pumps out tons of quality work)
*Binary Construct (made the Tedit map editing program - couldn't have made the map without it)
*Yoraizor (did I mention how helpful he's been? Can't thank him enough for helping me all the times I've been stumped by a mod issue)
*Eikester (made Game Launcher and improved tConfig installation)
