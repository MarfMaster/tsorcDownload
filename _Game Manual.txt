GAME MANUAL:
--------------------------------------------
*Create a new character named Red Cloud. 

*Make sure Adventure Mode is checked in the TSORC mod config options.

*A pickaxe or sticky bomb can be used to break blocks that are 1 width wide. Stone gates need switches to open. If in doubt, go for it! 

*Read signs in the order you come to them.

*Read all item tool-tips for hints and game clues, especially mod items.

*If items found in chests are a "material," they can likely be crafted into something else with Dark Souls

*Don't move vanilla NPC's like the Wizard, Mechanic or Goblin Tinkerer until you've found them in game. Modded NPCs may be moved.

*Dark Souls have special properties. On death, you will drop all your souls and have one chance to recover them. Die before this and they are gone for good. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*Want to play multiplayer? Just turn off the two souls related options in the TSORC mod config. The map supports up to 3 players. Class diversity recommended.

TIPS & HINTS
-------------------------------------------------

*Use health regen/defence potions during normal combat and when retrieving lost souls. Hoarded potions are of no use to the dead! ;)

*Future pickaxes will be used as keys to open gates made of ore. 

*Play with the Recipe Browser mod to easily check what mod items can be crafted (using dark souls and normal items found in chests).

*The Greater Magic Mirror provides some major benefits for fast travel and convenience. It can also be used to return to a tricky spot quickly, if you can remember to set your spawn point. 

*Some friendly NPCS will sell new items after defeating certain bosses...

*Dark Souls are used for 99% of all special mod items, weapons and armors you can craft, and usually in combination with other found materials. 99% of regular Terraria content will be looted from chests.

*Play with Auto-Pause turned ON (this will make reading signs and crafting stress free) and don't forget to use Quick Heal 

*Recommended Hot Keys: Pause/Inventory (R), Quick Heal (F), Quick Buff (B), Quick Mana (C), Grapple (E)

*You may be able to fight a boss before you are able to beat it. If in doubt, continue exploring, leveling up your gear, and come back when you're stronger.

*All boss summoning items are non-consumable so that you don't have to worry about running out of summoning chances. 

*You won't be able to craft everything on your first play-through, so you will need to make choices about what you want to invest your souls in.

*Keep an eye out for visual clues and secrets (there are many!)

*You can stash excess ammo, weapons and armors in the safes and piggy banks found at save points. 

*You can craft or buy potions and ammo or buy other basic stocks like these from NPCs. 

*You will not be able to farm bosses for souls, but you can farm bosses for the materials they drop.

*You will die. Probably a lot. But don't stress it. It is part of the risk/reward satisfaction of the game. If I succeeded, when you beat this game (and every dungeon in between) you will feel a real sense of accomplishment and triumph.

*Good luck and have fun!
