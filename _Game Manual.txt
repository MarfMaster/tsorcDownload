  :|:::       THE STORY OF RED CLOUD      :::|:



GAME MANUAL:
--------------------------------------------
*Create a new character named Red Cloud. 

*Make sure Adventure Mode is checked in the TSORC mod config options.

*Read signs in the order you come to them.

*Read all item tool-tips for hints and game clues, especially mod items.

*Don't move vanilla NPC's like the Wizard, Mechanic or Goblin Tinkerer until you've found them in game. Modded NPCs may be moved.

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*Want to play multiplayer? Just turn off the two souls related options in the TSORC mod config. The map supports up to 3 players. Class diversity recommended.

ENJOYED THIS MAP AND WANT TO SAY THANKS?
------------------------------------------------

The original TSORC released in 2012 was over 2 years in development (pre-and-post launch). The 2021 update for TModLoader has been another 9 months in development. If you'd like to support more work like this in the future or just want to say thanks, you can send me a tip via my Paypal account: https://paypal.me/timhjersted

No matter how you show it, thanks for your support, and thanks for playing!




TIPS & HINTS
-------------------------------------------------
*If loot you discover is a "material," it can likely be crafted into something else with Dark Souls

*Play with the Recipe Browser mod to easily see if loot dropped from enemies or found in chests can be crafted into something else

*Use health regen/defence potions during normal combat and when retrieving lost souls. Hoarded potions are of no use to the dead! ;)

*Dark Souls are used for 99% of all special mod items, weapons and armors you can craft, and usually in combination with other found materials. 99% of regular Terraria content will be looted from chests.

*Play with Auto-Pause turned ON (this will make reading signs and crafting stress free)

*Recommended Hot Keys: Pause/Inventory (R), Quick Heal (F), Quick Buff (B), Quick Mana (C), Grapple (E)

*You may be able to fight a boss before you are able to beat it. If in doubt, continue exploring, level up your gear, and come back when you're stronger.

*You can stash excess loot in the safe and piggy bank found at most save points. 

*You will not be able to farm bosses for souls, but you can farm bosses for the materials they drop.

*You will die. Probably a lot. But don't stress it. It is part of the risk/reward satisfaction of the game. If I succeeded, when you beat this game (and every dungeon in between) you will feel a real sense of accomplishment and triumph.

*Good luck and have fun!
